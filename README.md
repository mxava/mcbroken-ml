# mcbroken-ml

## What is it?
Inspired by Rashiq Zahid's McBroken, McBroken-ML is an ML model intended to track and calculate the likelihood of future McFlurry machine outages.

Tech Stack consists of: <br>
 - Kubernetes (AWS EKS, ECS, etc.) <br>
 - Nginx <br>
 - React/TypeScript Frontend <br>
 - Python/FastAPI Backend <br>
 - Postgresql Database <br>
 - Still deciding between Pytorch and Tensorflow for ML framework <br>

## Ok, but y tho?
I want to get some more hands-on experience with tools - gotta stay frosty!


### And with that, enjoy!
