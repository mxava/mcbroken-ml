# mcbroken-ml

## What is it?
Inspired by Rashiq Zahid's McBroken, McBroken-ML is an ML model intended to track and calculate the likelihood of future McFlurry machine outages.

Tech Stack consists of:
Kubernetes (AWS EKS, ECS, etc.)
Nginx
React/TypeScript Frontend
Python/FastAPI Backend
Postgresql Database
Still deciding between Pytorch and Tensorflow for ML framework

## Ok, but y tho?
Because I want to get some more hands-on experience with tools! Gotta stay frosty.


### And with that, enjoy!
